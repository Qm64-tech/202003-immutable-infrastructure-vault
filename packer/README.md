# Packer builds for Hashicorp Vault

This directory contains ansible playbooks and packer build setup designed to 
create a VM Image containing all the requirements to deploy Vault.

It will provide:

* Hashicorp Vault installed
* Uncomplicated Firewall 
* Mosh and SSH configuration changed to a more limiting one

Mosh and SSH are by default enabled to allow debugging during the development of
these VM images. Ideally in production nobody will not be able to access them at 
all, and if I can do it then it is not Immutable Infrastructure! ðŸ˜œ

This image will not contain any configuration, if not a basic "run for fun"
as it has been designed to be configured by [CloudInit](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io)
